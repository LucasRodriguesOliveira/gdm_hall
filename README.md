# Hall

gdm_hall

GDM Back-end engineer test Project

## Description

Hall is a front-end react/next application with the purpose to show results and interact directly with [Scribe API](http://github.com/LucasRodriguesOliveira/gdm_scribe) and [Whisper API](http://github.com/LucasRodriguesOliveira/gdm_whisper) to manage contact data, such as new contacts, list, and integration via file upload (csv);

## Run Project Locally

You can run the development server with:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

For a more quick response in loading the pages, you can generate a build and run a production build:

```bash
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

This project is expected to run with other projects such as [Scribe](http://github.com/LucasRodriguesOliveira/gdm_scribe), [Whisper](https://github.com/LucasRodriguesOliveira/gdm_whisper) and [Forge](https://github.com/LucasRodriguesOliveira/gdm_forge)

It's recommended to run the other projects before, so you can interact without errors. You can start this project before the others, but would be better waiting for **Scribe**, **Forge** and **Whisper** to run

## Tests

This project works perfectly as a e2e test suite for **Scribe** and **Whisper**, suit for yourself
